## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't already.

```sh
npm install elr-scss-lightbox --save
yarn add elr-scss-lightbox
```

## Documentation

This package is styles only. It's up to you to hook up the JavaScript. I decided to leave out interactivity to make these styles useful across any JavaScript framework. Or no framework at all.

```scss
.lightbox {
  @include elr-screen-overlay;
}
```
